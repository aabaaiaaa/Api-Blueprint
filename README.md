# API Blueprint

Simple project to try out API Blueprints (https://apiblueprint.org) using the traditional Kerbal Space Program theme where space flights are managed as well as crew.

## Set up

Using Visual Studio Code, using the terminal in VS Code, run `dotnet build` at the parent directory to get dependencies and compile both projects.

You will need .Net Core 2.1 installed.

## Running the projects

Run `dotnet run` against the WebAPI project to be able to run requests against it via Postman. 

Run `dotnet test` against the Test project to run tests.

## API Blueprint documentation

You can find this in the root called `first-api-blueprint.md`. It uses the structure and format as per the documentation at https://apiblueprint.org.
